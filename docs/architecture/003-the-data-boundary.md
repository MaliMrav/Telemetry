# 003 — The Data Boundary

## Why should the application not care where data comes from?

A weather application needs information.

That information might come from:

- a local sensor
- MQTT
- an HTTP API
- a database
- a simulated source
- another system

The application should not need to know which one.

## The original temptation

A small application often begins like this:

```text
WeatherScreen
    │
    ▼
MQTT
    │
    ▼
Broker
```

The screen is now coupled to the transport mechanism.

It is no longer asking:

> What is the current temperature?

It is asking:

> How do I retrieve the temperature from MQTT?

Those are different questions.

## Observations and information

Telemetry separates observations from the systems that transport them:

```text
┌─────────────────────┐
│      Observation    │
│   temperature=21.4  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│     Data Source     │
│   MQTT / Sensor / API│
└──────────┬──────────┘
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│     Application     │
│   Uses information  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

The data source obtains data.

The application uses it.

## The boundary

```text
Application
    │
    ▼
IDataSource
    │
    ├── MQTT
    ├── Local Sensor
    ├── HTTP API
    └── Simulation
```

The application asks for data.

It does not need to know how that data arrived.

## Why does this matter?

If the source changes from MQTT to a local sensor, a screen coupled to MQTT must change.

A screen depending on the data contract can remain unchanged.

The implementation changes.

The application does not.

## The lesson

A data source is a capability.

Transport is an implementation detail.

The application should consume information through a stable boundary.

Telemetry deliberately stops before intelligence.

It observes.

It transforms observations into useful information.

It leaves reasoning, automation and decision-making to systems above it.
