# Architecture

This directory records the architectural decisions that shaped Telemetry.

Each document begins with a pressure: something became difficult, something no longer fit, or a new capability created a new question.

The architecture then evolved in response.

## How to Read These Documents

Each document answers a question created by the previous one:

Architecture is not a collection of disconnected diagrams.

It is a response to pressure.

The same principle applies to the engineering notebook as a whole.

The purpose of recording the pressure is not to present a flawless history.

It is to preserve the reasoning that led to the decisions.

That is part of the architecture.
